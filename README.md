Code Academy - Web Development Project

Project Overview

This project was one of my first-year web development assignments, where I created a web-based Code Academy platform designed to provide interactive learning resources for coding enthusiasts. It features a range of educational tools such as quizzes, coding tutorials, and a tutor-finding service. The platform is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to deliver a clean, responsive user interface.

I received a grade of 60 out of 100 for this project, which provided me valuable insights into the fundamentals of web development and how to build structured, interactive websites.

Features

Quizzes: Users can test their knowledge with interactive quizzes at three levels (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced) in various programming topics.
Courses: The platform offers tutorials and external learning resources, with lessons covering foundational and advanced topics in programming languages such as Python.
Tutor Search: A dynamic tutor-finding feature allows users to search for coding tutors based on their location.
User Authentication: A login page provides basic access control, linking to the main platform.
Responsive Design: The project leverages Bootstrap to ensure responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes.

Technologies Used

HTML5/CSS3: For structuring content and styling the platform.
Bootstrap: To implement a mobile-first, responsive design framework.
JavaScript: For quiz logic, interactive features, and dynamic content loading.
Boxicons/Lineicons: For modern and clean iconography throughout the platform.

Key Sections

Home Page: A welcome section introducing users to Code Academy with an engaging message.
Quizzes: Three levels of quizzes, each with multiple-choice questions to assess the user's progress.
Python Course: A section featuring embedded video tutorials and lessons on core Python programming concepts.
Tutor Search: A functional form allowing users to search for tutors in their city and country.
Login Page: A simple, interactive login form for user access, with an option to retrieve forgotten passwords.

Future Improvements

Adding more course content for other programming languages.
Improving the backend functionality for user authentication and tutor matching.
Enhancing the UI/UX to include more interactive animations and feedback for user actions.
